Learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and ADHD significantly impact students’ academic performance and overall development, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail to address these challenges effectively. This research proposes a mobile application that leverages advanced technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, image processing, and natural language processing (NLP), to identify these disabilities and provide tailored educational support. The application analyzes specific characteristics of each disability: reading patterns and spelling errors for dyslexia, numerical and math-related errors for dyscalculia, handwriting samples for dysgraphia, and behavioral patterns for ADHD. By integrating these technologies, the app delivers personalized learning plans and timely interventions, enabling early identification and support for students at risk of learning disabilities. The system incorporates culturally sensitive and context-aware features, ensuring its applicability across diverse educational settings. Additionally, the app provides real-time feedback to parents and educators, offering actionable insights and customized strategies to enhance the child’s learning experience. The proposed solution is designed to be accessible, scalable, and user-friendly, with a focus on improving educational equity and accessibility. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in accurately identifying learning disabilities and recommending targeted interventions. This approach aims to revolutionize the identification and management of learning disabilities, fostering better long-term outcomes for students with diverse learning needs...
